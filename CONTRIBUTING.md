   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   pip install pytest black flake8 mypy
   ```

5. **Set up Environment Variables**

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length of 88 characters (Black formatter)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Formatting

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting:

```bash
black email_sender.py test_setup.py
```

### Linting

We use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting:

```bash
flake8 email_sender.py test_setup.py
```

### Type Checking

We use [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for type checking:

```bash
mypy email_sender.py test_setup.py
```

### Documentation

- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include type hints for function parameters and return values
- Update README.md for new features

Example docstring:
```python
def send_email(self, recipient_data: dict) -> bool:
    """Send a single email to a recipient.
    
    Args:
        recipient_data: Dictionary containing recipient information
                       with keys 'email', 'name', 'company'
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if email sent successfully, False otherwise
    
    Raises:
        SMTPException: If email sending fails
    """
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the setup test
python test_setup.py

# Run with pytest (if you add pytest tests)
pytest tests/
```

### Writing Tests

- Create tests for new features
- Ensure good test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies (like SMTP)

Example test:
```python
def test_send_email_success():
    """Test successful email sending."""
    sender = BulkEmailSender()
    recipient = {
        'email': 'test@example.com',
        'name': 'Test User',
        'company': 'Test Company'
    }
    result = sender.send_email(recipient)
    assert result is True
```
